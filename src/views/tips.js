          <div className="subheader"> Establish a routine </div></div>
          <div className="tips_text">Try to establish a structural and sustainable routine 
          that allow you to keep your studies going and get them done. Remember to create 
          variations in your routines to increase stimulation and avoid monotony, step out 
          and get fresh air, move around, reinforce your social contacts and rest. Plan your 
          time so that you know in advance when and what to study and make sure to rest after 
          every study session. If you sense that it is somehow difficult, use your alarm clock 
          to remind and help you with the transitions in your planning. </div>

          <div className="subheader"> Start the day well </div></div>
          <div className="tips_text">Getting up at the same time every day, refresh and get 
          dressed, get everything in order and have breakfast. Why not go for a short walk or 
          bike ride – do something you might have done if you had gone to university. Create a 
          routine to get the day started. </div>
 
          <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">3 </div>  
          <div className="subheader">Take a break - divide the time into short sessions </div></div>
          <div className="tips_text">Breaks and rest are as important as the study 
          sessions in order to be able to maintain focus, concentration and quality in your 
          studies. Think through before you start your studies- what breaks or activities 
          might work best for you and allow you to regain your energy. It is often helpful 
          to take a breath of fresh air or move around a little especially when you have been 
          sitting still and studying for a while. Be curious and try new ways to get refreshed. 
          You will need several shorter and a few longer breaks during the study durations. 
          Taking breaks not only gives the brain time to sort and process what you have just 
          written or read, but it also solidifies memorization. Also, try to find ways to take 
          breaks that do not go beyond the planned time breaks. Remember that most of us have 
          ended up watching several episodes of a TV series despite thinking of watching only 
          one episode. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">4 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Meals and mealtimes </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Eating a meal or having a cup of coffee can be an 
         excellent way to take breaks from your study sessions. It is also important to eat 
         somewhat healthy food in order to be able to study well. It is quite normal that we 
         tend to neglect what we eat especially when we are alone and did not make any plans 
         in advance. Try to think through what times suit best your planning and consider how 
         you can turn meals and coffee breaks into a wholesome rest during your studies. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">5 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Contact with others </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Given that you are unable to meet classmates and other 
         students at the university you need to get creative and find other ways to have (at 
         least some) social contact. For example, try to talk to others via services like 
         skype, FaceTime, or simply on the phone. As long as you all are symptom free, you 
         can also meet with a few others outside or at someone’s home. Take the initiative to 
         reach out; most people are in the same position as you. If you do not know anybody from 
         your courses try to keep in touch with other friends and your family if that is possible 
         for you. You are going to need this more than ever. <br></br><br></br>
         A good tip: watch a digital lecture together with a classmate or to “check in” via chat 
         or other to show that “we are learning” together. Dare to take initiative to ask others in 
         your class when you have a question or if you like to discuss something you read or 
         wrote. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">6 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Differentiate between studying and other time </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Try to plan your days so that you know when you are going 
         to study and when you are going to have “free time”. It is important to have realistic 
         goals. We tend to make unrealistic plans that we cannot really accomplish. It is better 
         to have a plan that you can successfully follow than to have ambitions that you cannot 
         accomplish. On a daily basis, evaluate how it went for you and adjust your planning in 
         the following days. By doing so, you increase the chances of accomplishing your 
         goals. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">7 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Place for studies </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Think about where you study best. Are there local places 
         available to you where you can study? It can also be helpful to establish a dedicated 
         space at home where you intend only to study and nothing else. That can be challenging 
         for those who live in a small room, nevertheless, try to be creative. A useful trick 
         is to switch on a certain light every time you study and to switch it off when you 
         take a break or do something else. That way you signalize yourself what mode to be in. 
         To study in bed may be tempting but it might hinder your rest at night. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">8 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Physical activity </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Because lectures, courses, and other classes are now held 
         remotely and many other activities are cancelled, you will probably be less physically 
         active than before. That is why it is important that you think on how to integrate some 
         physical activities in your day. Taking walks, cycling, doing yoga at home, dancing, 
         exercising outside are some options – no matter if you are on your own or with somebody 
         else. You also need fresh air to be energetic, focused, and to strengthen your immune 
         system. Your body appreciates all kinds of physical activity. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">9 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Variations  </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">To prevent boredom and monotony, you need stimulation, 
         variations and things to do other than your studies. Are there things you love to do 
         that are not just in the phone or screen? Do you enjoy baking, singing, painting, 
         jigsaw puzzles, recording movie clips, knitting, crocheting, reading fiction or 
         playing music? New situations can sometimes create opportunity to try new activities 
         and maybe find a new favorite activity. </div>

         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">10 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Repeat and prepare  </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">Read every day what has been brought up during lectures. 
         Summarize and repeat the most important. Also prepare for the upcoming lectures 
         since you control your time, studies and learning. Invest in understanding, not just 
         learning by heart. </div>
 
         <div className="tips_onsameline"><div className="numbers">11 </div>  
         <div className="subheader"> Concern </div></div>
         <div className="tips_text">It is quite normal to feel worried /concerned when a drastic 
         change occurs, and we constantly have to rethink the decisions in our everyday life. 
         Continue doing the things that you feel good about, even if it does not feel meaningful. 
         Being physically active is fundamental and often helpful. Try to maintain your routines 
         or create new ones that fit the situation. It is also easy for us to take in too much of 
         the news reporting or conversations about what is happening. Be observant and try to find 
         a balance on what you hear or take in so that you do not end up distorting your perspective 
         by only thinking “black and white”.  In addition, remember that you are always welcome to 
         make an appointment via phone call to us at Student Health Services.</div> <br></br>
